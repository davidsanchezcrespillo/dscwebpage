#ICT

I'm currently working as an __Information and Communication Assistant__ for the [DG Interpretation of the European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/scic). My work is related to __web development and administration__. I use a number of programming languages, technologies and operating systems, and I try to choose the right tool to solve every particular problem.

I'm particularly interested about __best practices__ in software development, and the way they contribute to build better products, and make the life of developers easier.
