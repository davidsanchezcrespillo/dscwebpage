#ICT

I currently work as a Web developer / Administrator for the [DG Interpretation of the European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/scic). I use a number of programming languages, technologies and operating systems, choosing the right tool to solve every particular problem.

I'm particularly interested about __best practices__ in software development, and also about the Free Software philosophy.
